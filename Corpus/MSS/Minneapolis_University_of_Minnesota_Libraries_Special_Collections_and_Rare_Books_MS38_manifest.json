On the bottom edge, also in pencil, is written in a modern hand: \"13851 'The Crucifixion', Book of Hours, France, c.1500\" . In the bottom right corner there is \"60-hico 4R\". Lineation with ink is visible. The recto side is the opening page of the Office of the Hours. A large illustration of the crucifixion, with Jesus and 2 women, in blue, browns, red and green with gold, takes up half the page. A small amount of text (7 lines) is surrounded by filigree and leaf designs in red, blue and green with brown. The text begins with a large, illuminated \"D\" in blue, brown, white and gold. Each new line begins with a somewhat smaller illuminated initial. The entire written space is enclosed in a simple brown frame. Three rubricated practice curlicues appear outside of this frame. Verso the written space is much smaller. The frame around the text is gold, and the entire left margin is decorated with filigree and floral designs in red, blue, and green with much gold. The text is in a dark ink, which has faded through oxidation to brown. Key lines begin with illuminated initials. Instructions for the performance of the Mass are given in red ink. The text is a well-developed Gothic textualis. There are 31 lines of text in a single column."},{"label":"Contact Information","value":"University of Minnesota Libraries, Special Collections and Rare Books. 15G Elmer L.

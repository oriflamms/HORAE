At this late date Books of Hours were also being printed in great numbers by such famous French printers as Vostre, de Collins, and Tory. These were elaborately illustrated and frequently hand-colored. The cursive gothic script used in this leaf, with its boldly accented letters and flourished initials, borrowed heavily from the decorative chancery or legal hands of the XIIIth and XIVth centuries. It influenced the type face known as civilité, designed by Granjon, and first used in 1559 A.D."},{"label":"Contact Information","value":"University of Minnesota Libraries, Special Collections and Rare Books. 15G Elmer L.

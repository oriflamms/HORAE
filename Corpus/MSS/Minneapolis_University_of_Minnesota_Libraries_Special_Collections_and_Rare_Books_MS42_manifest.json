The majuscules are also decorated with these inks, with blue on the outside, gold in the middle and red in the center. Information from Catalogue: Mistakenly labeled a book of hours of the blessed Virgin mary. The seller probably mistook Mars for Mary. Additional Notes: \"4\" marked in pencil on the upper right corner of the recto. There are no other pencil markings, but there is a tiny man-made hole (about 1/2mm in diameter) at the top of the leaf as well as five slightly larger man-made holes (1mm in diameter) placed within the grid. From the view point of the recto, the first is found over the M in Mars, the second is found directly next to the a in aubin. The third is in the 6th row down, 4th column. The fourth is in the 9th row down, 4th column. The fifth is in the 10th row down, 4th column. On the digital scan of the leaf it would be easy to mistake one of these holes for an ink dot. This leaf is in good condition. The recto is side from which hair was removed. The first majuscule is the \"AD,\" which stands for \"ante diem.\" Subsequent to \"AD\" appear all letters in a cycle starting with d, ending in g and the beginning at a. Sometimes a saint's name is listed next to a letter. These letters mark the days of the week as is standard in the Roman calendar. The incipit - Mars - is the month. to the right of the letters representing the days of the week are n', id' or kl'. These stand for the divisions of the month: nones, ides and kalends. The Roman numerals to the far left give the date in relation to nones, ides or calends. For example XIX A n' is 19 days before nones. See Bickerman, E. J. The Chronology of the Ancient World.

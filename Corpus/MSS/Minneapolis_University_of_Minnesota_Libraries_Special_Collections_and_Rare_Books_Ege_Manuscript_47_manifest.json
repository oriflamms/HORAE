In this leaf French characteristics predominate, but in no other country did the study of nature have a more direct influence on miniatures and ornamentations that in the Netherlands. Carnations, pansies, columbines, and many other flowers were faultlessly and realistically drawn. A few decades later, at the turn of the century, cast shadows as well as snails, butterflies, and birds were added with the result that the borders became a distraction to the reader."},{"label":"Contact Information","value":"University of Minnesota Libraries, Special Collections and Rare Books. 15G Elmer L.
